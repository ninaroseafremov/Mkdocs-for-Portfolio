# Structured Authoring in DITA

![Old Fashioned](drink.jpg)

For this assignment, I created a set of instructions on how to make an Old Fashioned. I did so using the Oxygen XML developer. I would say that this was my favorite assignment for this class. Over the course of the pandemic, we all picked up new hobbies to keep ourselves entertained as we stayed home. For fun, I became an amateur bartender. This assignment was a productive way to share some things that I picked up concerning my new hobby.
While I was at first overwhelmed with the new software, it became quite fun to explore once I got the hang of navigating Oxygen. I also had the opportunity to help some of my peers work with Oxygen; I had to ask people for help fairly often over the course of WRIT 4662w, so it felt nice to help them in return.
